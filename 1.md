1. When designing an identity management solution for a new Node.js microservice, what are the key architectual cosidereations you prioritize to ensure it's secure, scalable, and maintainable? How do these considerations differ when working with an external IdP like Okta versus and internal one like Active Directory?

keep auth logic centralized or implemented via middleware, use OAuth 2.0 and JWTs. Implement role based or attribute access. Abstract related logic into a dedicated service or module and design it in a way that supports switching identity providers if needed

Okta it is cloud-native and scales automatically

Active Directory is used in corporate environments and requires more complex setup and on-premises infrastructure
