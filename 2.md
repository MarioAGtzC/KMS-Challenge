2. Imagine users are reporting intermittent authentication failures in a Node.js application integrated with Okta. What would be your systematic approach to diagnose and resolve this issue? Beyond resolving, what best practices do you implement to prevent common security vulnerabilities related to authentication and authorization?

Review logs and check token validation(ensure are being validated correctly) as well inspect network and configuration issues(environment variables) and issues with Okta servers like timeouts, DNS resolution or rate limits

ensure tokens aren't returning expired or invalid data, make them short-lived and refresh as well as validate them properly (check signature, expiration, issuer and audience)
